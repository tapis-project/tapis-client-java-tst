        Add a permission to an existing role using a request body.  If the permission already exists, then the request has no effect and the change count returned is zero. Otherwise, the permission is added and the change count is one.  Permissions are case-sensitive strings that follow the format defined by Apache Shiro (https://shiro.apache.org/permissions.html).  This format defines any number of colon-separated (:) parts, with the possible use of asterisks (*) as wildcards and commas (,) as aggregators.  Here are two example permission strings:

            system:MyTenant:read,write:system1
            system:MyTenant:create,read,write,delete:*

        See the Shiro documentation for further details.  Note that the three reserved characters, [: * ,], cannot appear in the text of any part.  It's the application's responsibility to escape those characters in a manner that is safe in the application's domain.

        This request is authorized only if the authenticated user is either the role owner or an administrator.

        This read-only endpoint previews the transformations that would take place if the same input was used on a replacePathPrefix POST call. This call is also implemented as a POST so that the same input as used on replacePathPrefix can be used here, but this call changes nothing.

        This endpoint can be used to get an accounting of existing system/path combinations that match the input specification. Such information is useful when trying to duplicate a set of permissions. For example, one may want to copy a file subtree to another location and assign the same permissions to the new subtree as currently exist on the original subtree. One could use  this call to calculate the users that should be granted permission on the new subtree.

        The optional parameters are roleName, oldPrefix and newPrefix. No wildcards are defined for the path prefix parameters.  When roleName is specified then only permissions assigned to that role are considered.

        When the oldPrefix parameter is provided, it's used to filter out permissions whose paths do not begin with the specified string; when not provided, no path prefix filtering occurs.

        When the newPrefix parameter is not provided no new characters are prepended to the new path, effectively just removing the oldPrefix from the new path. When neither oldPrefix nor newPrefix are provided, no path transformation occurs, though system IDs can still be transformed.

        The result object contains an array of transformation objects, each of which contains the unique permission sequence number, the existing permission that matched the search criteria and the new permission if the specified transformations were applied.

        A valid tenant and user must be specified in the request body.  This request is authorized if the requestor is a user that has access to the specified tenant or if the requestor is a service.

        Replace the text in a permission specification when its last component defines an *extended path attribute*.  Extended path attributes enhance the standard Shiro matching algorithm with one that treats designated components in a permission specification as a path name, such as a posix file or directory path name.  This request is useful when files or directories have been renamed or moved and their authorizations need to be adjusted.  Consider, for example, permissions that conform to the following specification:

              files:tenantId:op:systemId:path

        By definition, the last component is an extended path attribute whose content can be changed by replacePathPrefix requests.  Specifically, paths that begin with the oldPrefix will have that prefix replaced with the newPrefix value.  Replacement only occurs on permissions that also match the schema and oldSystemId parameter values.  The systemId attribute is required to immediately precede the path attribute, which must be the last attribute.

        Additionally, the oldSystemId is replaced with the newSystemId when a match is found.  If a roleName is provided, then replacement is limited to permissions defined only in that role.  Otherwise, permissions in all roles that meet the other matching criteria will be considered.

        The optional parameters are roleName, oldPrefix and newPrefix. No wildcards are defined for the path prefix parameters.  When roleName is specified then only permissions assigned to that role are considered.

        When the oldPrefix parameter is provided, it's used to filter out permissions whose paths do not begin with the specified string; when not provided, no path prefix filtering occurs.

        When the newPrefix parameter is not provided no new characters are prepended to the new path, effectively just removing the oldPrefix from the new path. When neither oldPrefix nor newPrefix are provided, no path transformation occurs, though system IDs can still be transformed.

        The previewPathPrefix request provides a way to do a dry run using the same input as this request. The preview call calculates the permissions that would change and what their new values would be, but it does not actually change those permissions as replacePathPrefix does.

        The input parameters are passed in the payload of this request.  The response indicates the number of changed permission specifications.

        The path prefix replacement operation is authorized if the user@tenant in the JWT represents a tenant administrator or the Files service.

        Get all users in a tenant assigned a permission.  The permSpec parameter is a permission specification that uses colons as separators, the asterisk as a wildcard character and commas to define lists.  Here are examples of permission specifications:

            system:mytenant:read:mysystem
            system:mytenant:*:mysystem
            system:mytenant
            files:mytenant:read,write:mysystems
        This method recognizes the percent sign (%) as a string wildcard only in the context of database searching.  If a percent sign (%) appears in the permSpec it is interpreted as a zero or more character wildcard.  For example, the following specification would match the first three of the above example specifications but not the fourth:

            system:mytenant:%

        The wildcard character cannot appear as the first character in the permSpec.

        This request is authorized if the requestor is a user that has access to the specified tenant or if the requestor is a service.

        Get the permissions assigned to a user in a tenant, including those assigned transively.  The result list can be optionally filtered by the one or both of the query parameters: implies and impliedBy.

        The implied parameter removes permissions from the result list that the specified permission do not imply. The impliedBy parameter removes permissions from the result list that the specified permission are not implied by. Below are some examples.Consider a user that is assigned these permissions:

            stream:dev:read:project1
            stream:dev:read,write:project1
            stream:dev:read,write,exec:project1

        **Using the *implies* Query Parameter**

        When _implies=stream:dev:*:project1_, this endpoint returns:

            stream:dev:read:project1
            stream:dev:read,write:project1
            stream:dev:read,write,exec:project1

        When _implies=stream:dev:write:project1_, this endpoint returns an empty list.

        **Using the *impliedBy* Query Parameter**

        When _impliedBy=stream:dev:*:project1_, this endpoint returns an empty list.

        When _impliedBy=stream:dev:write:project1_, this endpoint returns:

        Read a versioned secret. By default, the latest version of the secret is read. If the *version* query parameter is specified then that version of the secret is read.  The *version* parameter should be passed as an integer with zero indicating the latest version of the secret. A NOT FOUND status code is returned if the secret version does not exist or if it's deleted or destroyed.

        The response object includes the map of zero or more key/value pairs and metadata that describes the secret. The metadata includes which version of the secret was returned.

        A valid tenant and user must be specified as query parameters.

        ### Naming Secrets
        Secrets can be arranged hierarchically by using the "+" characters in the *secretName*.  These characters will be converted to slashes upon receipt, allowing secrets to be arranged in folders.

        A secret is assigned a path name constructed from the *secretType* and *secretName* path parameters and, optionally, from query parameters determined by the *secretType*. Each *secretType* determines a specific transformation from the url path to a path in the vault.  The *secretType* may require certain query parameters to be present on the request in order to construct the vault path.  See the next section for details.

        ### Secret Types
        The list below documents each *secretType* and their applicable query parameters. Highlighted parameter names indicate required parameters. When present, default values are listed first and also highlighted.

          - **system**
            - *sysid*: the unique system id
            - *sysuser*: the accessing user (except when keytype=cert)
            - keytype: *sshkey* | password | accesskey | cert
          - **dbcred**
            - *dbhost*:  the DBMS hostname, IP address or alias

        Create or update a secret. The JSON payload contains a required *data* object and an optional *options* object.  It also contains the required tenant and user fields.

        The *data* object is a JSON object that contains one or more key/value pairs in which both the key and value are strings. These are the individual secrets that are saved under the path name. The secrets are automatically versioned, which allows a pre-configured number of past secret values to be accessible even after new values are assigned. See the various GET operations for details on how to access different aspects of secrets.

        NOTE: The *cas* option is currently ignored but documented here for future reference.

        The *options* object can contain a *cas* key and with an integer value that represents a secret version.  CAS stands for check-and-set and will check an existing secret's version before updating.  If cas is not set the write will be always be allowed. If set to 0, a write will only be allowed if the key doesn’t exist. If the index is greater than zero, then the write will only be allowed if the key’s current version matches the version specified in the cas parameter.

        Destroy one or more versions of a secret. Destroy implements a hard delete which delete that cannot be undone. It does not, however, remove any metadata associated with the secret.

        The input versions array is interpreted as follows:

           * [-] - empty = destroy all versions
           * [0] - zero = destroy only the latest version
           * [1, 3, ...] - list = destroy the specified versions

        A valid tenant and user must be specified in the body.

        ### Naming Secrets
        Secrets can be arranged hierarchically by using the "+" characters in the *secretName*.  These characters will be converted to slashes upon receipt, allowing secrets to be arranged in folders.

        A secret is assigned a path name constructed from the *secretType* and *secretName* path parameters and, optionally, from query parameters determined by the *secretType*. Each *secretType* determines a specific transformation from the url path to a path in the vault.  The *secretType* may require certain query parameters to be present on the request in order to construct the vault path.  See the next section for details.

        ### Secret Types
        The list below documents each *secretType* and their applicable query parameters. Highlighted parameter names indicate required parameters. When present, default values are listed first and also highlighted.

          - **system**
            - *sysid*: the unique system id
            - *sysuser*: the accessing user (except when keytype=cert)
            - keytype: *sshkey* | password | accesskey | cert
          - **dbcred**
            - *dbhost*:  the DBMS hostname, IP address or alias
            - *dbname*:  the database name or alias
            - *dbservice*: service name

        Validate a service's password. The JSON payload contains the password that needs to be validated against the password stored in the vault for the service specifiedin the X-Tapis-User header. The secret name is the path under whichthe password was stored.

        A valid tenant and user must also be specified in the payload.

        ### Naming Secrets
        Secrets can be arranged hierarchically by using the "+" characters in the *secretName*.  These characters will be converted to slashes upon receipt, allowing secrets to be arranged in folders.

        Only services can make this request.
