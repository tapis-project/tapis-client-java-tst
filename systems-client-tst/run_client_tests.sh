# Use mvn to run tests for the systems client
#   against the systems service running either locally or in k8s
#   and other services (tenants, sk, auth, tokens) running in DEV, STAGING, or PROD
# NOTE: For safety, for now do not allow running against PROD
# If requested use docker to start up the systems service locally using an image
#   - image used is based on TAPIS_RUN_ENV, for example tapis/systems:dev
# Use mvn to run the systems-client integration tests.
#
# The Tapis environment we are running in must be set to one of: dev, staging, prod
# It can be set using env var TAPIS_RUN_ENV or by passing in as first arg, but not both.
#
# To start up the systems service locally the following env variables must be set:
#     TAPIS_DB_PASSWORD
#     TAPIS_DB_JDBC_URL
#     TAPIS_SERVICE_PASSWORD
# By default service listens on port 8080. To change it set
#     TAPIS_SERVICE_PORT
#
# To run the client integration tests the following env variables must be set:
#   TAPIS_FILES_SERVICE_PASSWORD - used for testing credential retrieval
